# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Commit Policy

**NEVER commit without explicit user approval!**

### Rules:
1. ❌ **NEVER** run `git commit` unless the user explicitly asks
2. ✅ After implementing features, say "Ready for you to test/review"
3. ✅ Wait for user feedback and approval before committing
4. ✅ Only commit when user says "commit this" or "please commit these changes"
5. ✅ Ask "Would you like me to commit these changes?" if unclear

### Remember:
- Committing is the USER's decision, not mine
- The user controls their git history
- Present work for review, don't auto-commit it
- Even if changes are "done", wait for approval before committing

## Game Design Principles

**Target Audience: 5-year-old children who cannot read**

### Critical Rules:
1. ❌ **NO TEXT LABELS** - Children cannot read text instructions
2. ✅ Use audio, emojis, colors, and visual cues instead of text
3. ✅ All game instructions must be audio-based
4. ✅ UI should be purely visual and intuitive

### Examples:
- ❌ Bad: "Tryck på rätt sida" text label
- ✅ Good: Speaker emoji 🔊 + audio instructions
- ❌ Bad: "Försök: 3/25" progress text
- ✅ Good: Visual progress indicators (colored balls, hearts, etc.)
- ❌ Bad: "Vänster" and "Höger" text labels
- ✅ Good: Color-coded zones + audio saying the direction

### Remember:
- If you can't play the game without reading, it's wrong
- Audio + visuals only
- Keep it simple and intuitive for young children
